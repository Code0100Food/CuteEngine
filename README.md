## User guide

### Hierarchy

- Remove Entity: You can remove those entities with the "Remove Entity" button if the entity you want to remove is selected.

### Inspector
FOTO INSPECTOR

#### Name
You can change the name of the entity in the inpector and it is updated in the hierarchhy as well.

#### Transformation
Controls the position, rotation and scale of the entity. You can see the changes in the scene if you have something to render.

#### Mesh
Selected mesh that is rendered on the scene from the loaded meshes on the resources.
In order to change the mesh selected there is a droplist to choose from.

#### Light
Adds a directional light into the scene.
You can change the light color and intensity.

#### Toggle grid
A toggle to decide if the grid should be rendered or not in the scene.

### Resources
List of the loaded resources. Includes meshes and textures.

#### Load resources
In order to load a resource simply drag and drop them on the engine.

### Menu Bar

![](FOTO MENU BAR)

#### Open project
Open the project selected in the dialog window and close the current one.

#### Close project
Closes the actual project.

#### Render mode
From the menu bar you can chose a render mode in order to show the resultant texture of a concrete render process. You can choose from the following:
- Shaded color: All the textures mode combined, in other words the final result.
- Normals: Shows the normals of the current rendered meshes.
- Depth: Shows the depth buffer (Z buffer).
- Albedo: Shows the color of the scene.
- Selection: The texture used to generate the selected effect. In this mode we can see the selected object drawn in white.

### Camera controls
- Translation: In order to move the camera in the axis you can use WASD controlls from the keyboard while holding the right mouse key button down.
- Rotation: While holding down the Alt button and the left mouse button, you can move the mouse to rotate the camera around a point.
- Padding: While holding down the center mouse button and moving the mouse you can move the camera in axis x and y.
- Zoom: Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
- Focus object: Press the F key in order to focus the current selected object.

### Grid
There is a grid on the scene that is procedurally generated by shaders.

### Bloom
The bloom effect consist in highlighting the brightest pixels of a texture.
In order to generate a glare effect, these steps had been followed:
1. Pick the texture to apply the bloom.
2. Save the brightest pixels of the targeted texture in a new texture.
3. Apply blur effect on the new generated texture using different texture buffers and levels of detail.
4. Add this blured texture to the final scene render texture.

### Selection
This effects highlights the selected object drawing a colored line around it.
In order to generate the selection effect, these steps had been followed:
1. Finding the selected object from the scene and drawing it individually in a new black texture using white color.
2. Detect the color changes on the texture and paint them with the desired color using shaders.
